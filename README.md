_a121-rs_ is a Rust library providing a high-level abstraction for interfacing with the Acconeer A121 V-Band radar sensor. Designed for use in embedded systems, it offers asynchronous operation through embedded-hal traits, making it a perfect fit for no_std environments.

_a121-rs_ aims to simplify the development process for applications requiring accurate distance measurements and presence detection, leveraging the unique capabilities of the A121 radar sensor.

## Features

_a121-rs_ comes with a host of features designed to make working with the A121 sensor as straightforward as possible:

- **No Standard Library Dependencies**: Fully compatible with `no_std` for embedded systems use.
- **Embedded-HAL Async**: Utilizes asynchronous traits from `embedded-hal` for non-blocking sensor operation.
- **Configurable**: Provides a flexible API to configure the radar sensor for various measurement modes and parameters.
- **Examples Provided**: Includes examples for popular hardware platforms like ESP32 and STM32.

### Supported Operating Modes

- **Distance Measurement**: Configure the radar for precise distance measurements to objects.
- **Presence Detection**: Detect the presence of objects or people in a configured detection zone. (Soon)

## Dependencies

The following dependencies are required to use _a121-rs_:
- Acconeer A121 Static Library (and detector libraries for distance and presence detection if the feature is enabled)
- 'arm-none-eabi-gcc' to build the C wrapper for the stm32 examples
```bash
# Ubuntu
sudo apt-get install gcc-arm-none-eabi
```
- esp toolschains to build the esp examples, install via espup (https://github.com/esp-rs/espup) 

## Supported Targets
Supported platforms depend on the availability of the Acconeer A121 Static Library.
Currently, the following targets are supported:
- arm-none-eabihf (gcc, armcc, armclang)
- esp xtensa and riscv

## Getting Started

To include _a121-rs_ in your project, add the following to your `Cargo.toml`:

```toml
[dependencies]
a121-rs = "0.1"
```

The static library expects implementations of math functions like `sqrt` and `sin` to be available.
If you are using a platform that does not provide these functions, you can enable the `libm` feature to use the `libm` crate for floating point operations


See the [documentation](https://docs.rs/a121-rs) for detailed usage instructions and examples.

## Feature flags
feature | description
--- | ---
distance | Enable distance measurement module
presence | Enable presence detection module (coming soon)
libm | Use libm crate for floating point operations
nightly-logger | If the C wrapper for logging does not compile with stable rust, enable this feature to use nightly rust with a custom logger

## Examples

Check out the `examples/` directory for demonstrations on how to use _a121-rs_ with various microcontroller units.
These examples cover basic setups and common use cases to help you get started quickly.

**Note:** For the esp32c6 example, you need to do additional steps before you can compile successfully:
- Add the static libraries (.a) to the acc folder, you can request these from Acconeer
- Run the export-esp.sh script to bring `riscv32-esp-elf-gcc` into your path (as generated by espup)
- Set two environment variables:
  - `CROSS_COMPILE="riscv32-esp-elf"`
  - `CPATH="/home/<user>/.rustup/toolchains/esp/riscv32-esp-elf/esp-12.2.0_20230208/riscv32-esp-elf/riscv32-esp-elf/include"` (replace `<user>` with your username and find the specific version on your system)
