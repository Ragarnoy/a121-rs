/**
 * @brief Pulse Repetition Frequency
 *
 * Pulse Repetition Frequency, PRF, is the frequency at
 * which pulses are sent out from the radar system. The
 * measurement time is approximately proportional to the
 * PRF. The higher the PRF, the shorter the measurement time.
 *
 * This parameter sets the Maximum Measurable Distance, MMD,
 * that can be achieved. MMD is the maximum value for the end point,
 * i.e.,the start point + (number of points * step length).
 * For example, an MMD of 7.0 m means that the range cannot
 * be set further out than 7.0 m.
 *
 * It also sets the Maximum Unambiguous Range, MUR, that can be achieved.
 * MUR is the maximum distance at which an object can be located to guarantee
 * that its reflection corresponds to the most recent transmitted pulse.
 * Objects farther away than the MUR may fold into the measured range.
 * For example, with a MUR of 11.5 m, an object at 13.5 m could become
 * visible at 2 m.
 *
